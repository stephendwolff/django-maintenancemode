Changes
=======

0.10
----

- Got rid of dependency on setuptools
- Added ability to exclude specific paths from maintenance mode with the
  ``MAINTENANCE_IGNORE_URLS`` setting.
- Use RequestContext when rending the ``503.html`` template.
- Use tox for running the tests instead of buildout.
- Made sure the app runs on Django 1.4.

0.9.3
-----
- Minor documentation updates for the switch to github, expect more changes to follow soon.

0.9.2
-----
- Fixed an issue with setuptools, thanks for reporting this ksato9700

0.9.1
-----

- Tested django-maintenancemode with django-1.0 release (following the 1.0.X release branch)
- Bundled buildout.cfg and bootstrap with the source version of the project, allowing repeatable buildout
- The middleware now uses its own default config file, thanks to a patch by semente
- Use INTERNAL_IPS to check for users that need access. user.is_staff will stay in place for backwards incompatibility. Thanks for the idea Joshua Works
- Have setup.py sdist only distribute maintenancemode itself, no longer distribute tests and buildout stuff
- Use README and CHANGES in setup.py's long_description, stolen from Jeroen's djangorecipe :)
- Updated the documentation and now use pypi as the documentation source (link there from google code)
